I am an Associate Professor at the Department of Mathematics at the State University of New York at New Paltz. 

I am working on probability theory, especially jump-type Lévy processes. Recently, I am working on studying geometry of domains in the Euclidean space using spectral objects such as trace, heat content, or torsional rigidity with respect to jump processes. I am also interested in studying fractal structures related to Lévy processes.  

You can find more about my research in the Research tap.

I am an organizer for Math and Cookies at the mathematics department. This is an introductory research talk for our undergraduate students in a friendly atmosphere (with cookies). If you'd like to give a talk, please contact me at parkh@newpaltz.edu.
